# cl0ned-MK2-firmware
Firmware for the cl0ned Prusa i3 MK2 printer that was upgraded by the cl0ned team during the 2016 UBC HY3P Competition

Based on the Prusa firmware but modified to account for the shortened space between the nozzle and bed as well as the extra retract and extrude length needed when loading and unloading filament.

Created extra funcitonality with a filament runnout sensor that used an induction sensor and some magnets with a encoding wheel that would track filament movement.
